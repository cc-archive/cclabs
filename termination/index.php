<p>Welcome to the Creative Commons Termination of Transfer Tool.  On this page we briefly explain what
termination of transfer is all about, and how this tool can work for you.  If you like exploring as much
as we do, try the navigation links over there to the right and at the bottom of the page.  And don't be scared
to click on scary looking legal terms; we've put definitions for you over in our glossary.

<h3 id="how_can_it_assist">How can this tool assist you?</h3>

<p>Are you the creator of a book, a cartoon, a screenplay, a movie, artwork, or some other
type of creative <a class="glossarylink" href="glossary.html#work">work</a> that is protected by
<a class="glossarylink" href="glossary.html#copyright_law">copyright law</a>?<br>
<br>
Are you a <a class="glossarylink" href="glossary.html#descendants">spouse, widow, other relative or authorized
representative</a> of an <a class="glossarylink" href="glossary.html#author">author or artist</a>?<br>
<br>
Did you or the <a class="glossarylink" href="glossary.html#author">author or artist</a> enter into
an <a class="glossarylink" href="glossary.html#agreement">agreement or transfer</a> in relation to that work with
someone else who is now reaping commercial benefits from your or the author or artist's
hard work and you would now like to share in the benefits?</p>

<p>If so, this tool may assist you to terminate that agreement or transfer.  Terminating
the agreement means that the rights in the work return to you, and you are again in control
of all of the rights in relation to your work.</p>

<p>To learn more about this tool and whether it might be useful for you, feel free to check out
our <a href="faq.php">FAQ</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what_does_it_mean">What does this mean for you?</h3>

<p>Under US law, <a class="glossarylink" href="glossary.html#author">authors and artists</a> and, in some cases, their
<a class="glossarylink" href="glossary.html#descendants">spouse, widow, other relatives or authorized representatives</a>
have the chance to terminate earlier <a class="glossarylink" href="glossary.html#agreement">agreements or transfers</a>
that they may have entered into many years ago before they
knew how successful or profitable their work would be.  Under certain provisions of the
US Copyright Act, commonly called the "termination of transfer" provisions,
authors and artists, and in some cases,
their spouse, widow, other relatives or authorized representatives
can terminate these agreements and reclaim their US rights.
They can then negotiate new licensing and other deals with the strength of the knowledge of
market value of their work.</p>

<h3 id="what_does_it_do">What does this tool do?</h3>

<p>This tool is designed to make it easier for you to exercise your rights to terminate
<a class="glossarylink" href="glossary.html#agreement">agreements and transfers</a> that you or an
<a class="glossarylink" href="glossary.html#author">author or artist</a> entered into
before being able to assess the true market for the work.  Specifically, this tool
can assist you in identifying whether you may have a right to terminate an agreement
or transfer and if so, it calculates, based on the information you provide, whether
you may be to activate your termination right at the moment.  In addition, this tool
gathers some basic details about the creation and exploitation
of the work that can be passed to either a lawyer or a
<a class="glossarylink" href="glossary.html#clinic">participating law clinic</a>
that can then represent you in effecting your termination rights.</p>
