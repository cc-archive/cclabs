<p>Welcome to the Creative Commons Termination of Transfer Tool. On this page we briefly explain what
termination of transfer is all about, and how this tool can work for you. For more detailed information,
please take a look at our <a href="faq.php">FAQ</a>.  If you like exploring as much
as we do, try the navigation links on the right and at the bottom of the page. And don't be shy
about clicking on scary looking legal terms; we've put definitions for you in our
<a class="glossarylink" href="glossary.html">glossary</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how_can_it_assist">How can this tool assist you?</h3>

<p>Are you the creator of a book, a cartoon, a screenplay, a movie, a piece of artwork, or some other
type of creative work that is protected by <a class="glossarylink" href="glossary.html#copyright_law">U.S. copyright law</a>?<br>
<br>
Perhaps you are a <a class="glossarylink" href="glossary.html#authors_family">family member or authorized representative</a>
of such an <a class="glossarylink" href="glossary.html#author">author or artist</a>?<br>
<br>
Was the creator's copyrighted work sold or transferred to someone else who is now reaping commercial rewards from it?<br>
<br>
Would you like to get back the rights to the work?</p>

<p>If so, this tool may help you determine whether you can terminate that
<a class="glossarylink" href="glossary.html#agreement">agreement or transfer</a>.
"Terminating" the agreement means that the rights to the work return to you - you are back in control
of all of the rights in relation to your work.*</p>

<h3 id="what_does_it_mean">What does this mean for you?</h3>

<p>Under certain circumstances, US law allows an <a class="glossarylink" href="glossary.html#author">author or artist</a>
(and sometimes a <a class="glossarylink" href="glossary.html#authors_family">family member or authorized representative</a>)
to cancel an <a class="glossarylink" href="glossary.html#agreement">agreement</a> in which the rights to a copyrighted work
were sold or transferred, particularly when the agreement was made many years ago - before anyone knew how successful
or profitable that work would become. These provisions of the US Copyright Act are commonly called the "termination of transfer" rules.
A successful termination allows the beneficiary to negotiate new licenses and other deals with knowledge of the actual
market value of their work.</p>

<h3 id="what_does_it_do">What does this tool do?</h3>

<p>This tool will hopefully make it easier for you to identify and exercise "termination" rights under U.S. copyright law.
Specifically, this tool assists you in determining whether you may have a right to terminate a particular
<a class="glossarylink" href="glossary.html#agreement">agreement or transfer</a>, and, if so, it calculates
- based on the information you provide - whether you are actually allowed to activate this termination right at the moment.
The tool also gathers some basic details about the work, it's creation and it's exploitation.
This information can then be passed on to either a lawyer or a
<a class="glossarylink" href="glossary.html#clinic">participating law clinic</a> that can then represent you
in effecting your termination rights.  While this tool is in a BETA stage, however, the gathered information
will simply be summarized and presented in an Information Sheet.</p>

<p>To start working through the tool and see if you may be eligible to terminate an
agreement entered into in relation to a creative work and, if so, whether your
