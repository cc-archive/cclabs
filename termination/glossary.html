<h3><a href="#glossary-explain">Glossary</a></h3>
We realize that many of the terms used in the tool are difficult to understand.  Also, many are terms that have a particular legal meaning.  We've tried to explain some of the more complex or legalistic terms below in as plain language as we can.  Of course, none of our explanations are a substitute for the real legal definition of a term - they are just guides designed to assist you to better complete the tool! 
</div>

<div id="agreement">
<h3><a href="#agreement">Agreement or transfer</a></h3>
When used in this tool, this term means any agreement under which the author or artist of a copyrighted work grants another person certain or all of the rights in relation to that work.  Examples of the kinds of agreements that can be terminated are: assignment or transfer of ownership of copyright, an exclusive license, a mortgage or a non-exclusive license.  The agreement can refer just to one particular use of a copyrighted work such a license the right to distribute or publish the work; or it can refer to the entire copyright, such as an assignment of copyright ownership.  As a general rule, an assignment of ownership or an exclusive license should be in writing and signed by the person making the grant. 
</div>

<div id="author">
<h3><a href="#author">Authors and artists</a></h3>
When used in this tool, this term means the original creator of a work protected by copyright; the person who commits pen to paper, the person who makes the movie, hits "save" on the computer.

<div id="children">
<h3><a href="#children">Children</a></h3>
As a general rule, the law that governs termination of agreements or transfers of copyright interests, "children" are defined as a person's immediate offspring, whether legitimate or not, and any children legally adopted.  The exact definition of "children" may vary for some works that were created before January 1, 1978 because it will depend on applicable state law.  If your work was created before January 1, 1978, it's probably best to treat the term "children" as broadly as possible so that you can see if a termination right otherwise exists and then you can raise this issue with the attorney who assists you with your termination notice. 
</div>

<div id="compilation">
<h3><a href="#compilation">Compilation</a></h3>

<h3><a href="#copyright_law">Copyright Law</a></h3>

<a target="_new" href="http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ1.html#wwp">here</a>.<br>
<br>
The protection that the law grants is in the form of exclusive rights.  The owner of copyright in a work has the ability to control who may exercise those exclusive rights and engage in certain activities with their work.  Under US copyright law, these activities include copying, distributing, performing to the public, adapting, displaying in public or transmitting the work online.

</div>

<div id="agreement_description">
<h3><a href="#agreement_description">Description of the Agreement or Transfer</a></h3>
When asked to describe the agreement or transfer, the tool is seeking information about the nature of the document; whether it is an assignment of copyright ownership, an exclusive license, a non-exclusive license or a mortgage.  If the agreement or transfer has been recorded in writing and signed, often the name or title of the document will provide the best description of it.

<div id="agent">
<h3><a href="#agent">Duly authorized agent</a></h3>
</div>

<div id="scope_of_employment">
<h3><a href="#scope_of_employment">Employment, work created within the scope of</a></h3>
There is no clear rule as to when a work is created within the scope of a person's employment and when it is not.  In general, a court will consider a range of factors including: the ability of the hiring party to control the manner and means of creation of works; the skill required; the provision of employee benefits; the tax treatment of the hired party; and whether the hiring party has the right to assign additional projects to the hired party.  If the hiring party has a large degree of control of the tasks performed and can assign additional projects on an ongoing basis as well as the hired party receiving employee benefits and being taxed as an employee, then it is more likely that a work is created within the scope of employment. Other factors may include who provides the tools and equipment (the hiring or hired party), the location of the work, the duration of the relationship between the parties, whether the hiring party hires and pays assistants and whether the work is part of the regular business of the hiring party.  If you are unsure as to whether the work in question was created within the circumstances of employment, you may want to get some legal advice on this issue.  Alternately, you can assume that the work was not created within circumstances of employment (works created in circumstances of employment are not eligible for termination) and continue to use the tool to see if a termination right otherwise arises.

<div id="instructional_text">
<h3><a href="#instructional_text">Instructional text (text and/or graphics)</a></h3>

As a general rule, it is intended to refer to what might loosely be called "textbook material," whether or not in book form or prepared in the form of a text.

<div id="publication_date">
<h3><a href="#publication_date">Publication (of the Work)</a></h3>
This term is defined by copyright law to mean the distribution of copies of a work to the public in some manner such as by sale or lending.  But the public performance or public display of a work does not constitute a publication.  This means, for example, that selling copies of a book or video to the public is a publication; but performing a play in a theatre is not a publication because no copy is distributed to the public.  Offering to distribute copies of a work to a person for the purpose of them further distributing, performing or displaying it to the public does, however, constitute a publication.  This covers, for example, offering a film to a broadcaster or movie theatre for them to them show it to the public.

<div id="supplementary_work">
<h3><a href="#supplementary_work">Supplementary work</a></h3>
This term means a work that is created and relates to an existing work by another author or artist.

</div>

<div id="widow">
<h3><a href="#widow">Widow(er)</a></h3>
When used in this tool, this term means the surviving spouse of the author or artist, according to the law governing in the author or artist's residence, as at the time of the author or artist's death.  For the purposes of copyright law, it does not matter if the spouse later remarries.  Again, because the law of each state may vary, it's best to interpret this term broadly when completing the tool so that you can see if a termination right may exist and then raise this issue with the attorney who assists you in preparing the termination notice.
</div>

<div id="work">
<h3><a href="#work">Work (protected by copyright law)</a></h3>
The technical meaning for this term is an original, creative expression that is embodied in a tangible form.  In plain English, this means that the work must have a minimum "spark of creativity" (an alphabetical ordering of names and addresses in a phone book is not sufficiently creative but most other things are) and must be recorded somehow, either written down, saved to disc, filmed, or recorded in such a fashion that it can be reproduced again.
</div>

<div id="work_for_hire">
<h3><a href="#work_for_hire">Work for hire</a></h3>

</div>

<div id="written_agreement">
<h3><a href="#written_agreement">Written agreement</a></h3>
When used in this tool, this term means a document or some other form of writing that records the parties' agreement.  As a general rule, the term means that the entire agreement between the parties is recorded in the one document.  Sometimes there may be more than one document, if, for example, the parties have later varied their agreement by anew document that serves as an addendum, appendix or variation of the original document.  This term will generally not mean a series of emails or letters in which each party sets out its understanding of the agreement at different times.
